1. Create keyboard shortcuts for npm run serve
2. Run through Array.prototype.map.call(sortableLists, (list) => {enableDragList(list)});

function enableDragSort(listClass) {
const sortableLists = document.getElementsByClassName(listClass);
Array.prototype.map.call(sortableLists, (list) => {enableDragList(list)});
}

function enableDragList(list) {
Array.prototype.map.call(list.children, (item) => {enableDragItem(item)});
}

As a user, I should be able to add destinations. I should be able to do this by using a form, click on a map (with an API call), or other approaches included.
Enter by form:
-- Create form fields
-- Create destinations list
-- Create add forms button
-- Click add forms and add marker to map and item to list

---

As a user, I should be able to rearrange the order of my destinations.
-- Ability to delete and reorder list (drag and drop)
As a user, I’d like to be able to see my destinations on a map.
As a user, I’d like to be able to see information about the distance and journey time between each destination.
As a user, I’d like to be able to see summary data about my entire journey. This could include the total time, distance and, for extra points, even the fuel needed.
As a user, I’d like my data to be stored in my browser’s local storage so I can navigate away from this page and come back with the data still there.
For extra challenge:

Display points of interest between each destination This can be achieved by either looking at popular attractions or asking the user about their interests.
For longer parts of the journey, suggest where users might take shortstops (i.e.hotels and their rates).
Use the dates of the road trip and suggest events of interest that are on the path.
