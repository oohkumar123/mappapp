when we reorder destinations, reorder array
    option 1
    -- click list add destination to array
    -- add order as well
    -- then when reorder list we can reorder elemtns in array either by changing the order number or by moving the whole element position
    -- if we reorder whole then we can use next item as a way to link two destinations
    -- if we just reorder according to the order number then we have to use a sort function when displaying destinations and making calculations
    -- advantage is that this becomes a single source of truth
option 2
    -- after moving element or adding element loop through the new positions and repopuloate the array
    -- then loop again making calculations for display

    how does either way affect summary informations
    -- easer if the data is in an array than in the dom

-- deal with git

-- delete locations from list and map 
-- form to enter locations both on map and list
-- sumarry data
-- local storage
-- css color scheme

extra 
--- Display points of interest between each destination This can be achieved by either looking at popular attractions or asking the user about their interests.
--- For longer parts of the journey, suggest where users might take shortstops (i.e.hotels and their rates).
--- Use the dates of the road trip and suggest events of interest that are on the path.
