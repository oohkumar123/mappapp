Call Stack 
Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) 

Callback Queue
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) 

Event Loop:
It follows a specific order of execution:
When the call stack is empty, the event loop checks if there are any tasks in the callback queue.
If there are tasks in the callback queue, the event loop moves the first task to the call stack, executing it.
The process continues as long as there are tasks in the callback queue.

This mechanism allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks without blocking the main execution thread.
